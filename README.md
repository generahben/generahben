<b>I know you don't like bugs!</b>
<br/>
I've unlocked a secret in programming, so you'll no longer need Google to squash a bug. Spray an insecticide close to your desk and bugs will be scared of you. If bug eventually show up on your system, gently spray an insecticide on it. The bug will die ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž<br/>

Many years ago, I showed an application source code (CTRL + U) from a browser to a supposed developer and asked him how people build apps? He replied, these codes ain't written by human. Guess what? I believed him until I started writing them.

I'm honestly not scared of people who don't laugh but scared of logical errors.
